# Windows Form(s) App 2.0 (Unofficial)

Hello there! What you're seeing is an introduction to one of my very first template I've made. And the following text below will show you all the information you need.

### I. Information

This template is made from Windows Forms App (C#) with .NET Framework version 4.7.2, with a simple interface like this:

Fun fact: This code can actually work with .NET Framework 3.5+, altho I haven't tested for even older version.

Another Fun fact: This can run on Windows 7 (duh)

Another Another Fun fact: I use Visual Studio 2019 to make this

Note: The source code of the repository is the source code of the project, while the ZIP file in the Releases tab is the template made from the source code.

### II. How Do I Use This!?

 - Download the latest ZIP file in the Releases tab
 - Once you done downloading the ZIP file, move that ZIP file to:
	- For Visual Studio 2019: `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
	- For Visual Studio 2017: `C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates`
	- and hopefully, you get the idea
 - And That's it!
